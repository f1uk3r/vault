## Surprising power of Atomic Habits

Story: British cycling team were pretty mediocre before early 2000s. They hired Dave Brailsford as new performance Director. His main philosphy revolves around the idea "the aggregation of marginal gains". They implemented very small changes in the equipments, healthy habits, recovery, sleep, etc. In just 5 years British cycling team started dominating the cycling competitions. Ten year span between 2007-2017 is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better everyday counts for a lot in the long run
- Habits are double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
- If you wnat better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on the systems instead
You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your system.
