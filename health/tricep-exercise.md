# Tricep exercises

## [Jeff Mippard Tier list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpRMRhr0Ycc)

There are 3 heads of triceps

- Lateral head
- Medial head
- Long head 

### Pressdowns

Hits all the three tricep heads

- Rope pressdown: may help getting better mind muscle connection but the number of reps that you can perform with ropes is far lesser than you do with bar. B Tier
- Bar pressdown: easily overloadable. A tier
- Reverse grip pressdown: weakest of 3. 

### Overhead caple triceps extensions

Much better for long head. S+ tier (try with bar)

### Katana cable triceps extension

hits hands individually, so can basically push away the imbalances. Works in scapular plane, so feels good. Requires a bit of setup and learning curve is little bit higher so, A tier

- Skull crushers: S tier
- Cable triceps kickback: A tier
- Close grip pushups: C Tier
- Diamond pushups: B Tier
